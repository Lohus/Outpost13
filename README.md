## 🎯 Project Goal

Outpost13 is being developed to demonstrate proficiency in Unity development for mobile and PC/WebGL platforms.  
This project focuses on:

- Clean and scalable C# architecture (ScriptableObjects, event systems, interface segregation)
- UI systems with crafting and upgrade mechanics
- Environment effects (temperature, radiation, gas)
- Visual design using low-poly modeling and texturing
- Full solo production: code, design, models, and logic

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

> You arrive at a remote station to investigate why contact was lost.  
> As you restore systems and gather resources, you uncover the fate of the previous explorer...

- Isometric exploration with survival mechanics
- Upgrade structures (Generators, Recyclers)
- Craft items from gathered resources
- Survive in dangerous zones (radiation, gas, cold, heat)
- Story events unfold based on player progress
- Final choice: enter the portal or return to base
